        "Since the first of january 2021, I have been working to achieve an IBM Data Science Professional certification. The course teaches what it means to be a data scientist, and the tools that you need to succeed in this field.The classes included Python programming, SQL databases, machine learning, statistics, and more.  As a Capstone for the certification, students are required to define a business problem and pull data from the web and location data from Foursquare to solve it. This post details my process for determining the best spot in Dubai to open a Fast Food Restaurant, from problem statement to data preparation to analysis to recommendations. Detailed code for this project is located on GitHub and can be found at the end of this post."
